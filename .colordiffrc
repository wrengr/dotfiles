# If we need to specify which underlying diff command to use:
diff_cmd=diff
# N.B., must use the long-form flag --unified=N in order for it to
# get passed through to `diff` correctly; otherwise `diff` will
# complain about using the `-u`/`-U` flags for some reason.  There
# isn't really a decent way to specify things like that in this file;
# instead the manpage suggests using shell function wrappers.


# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# N.B., the naming of color options is a bit odd...
# The basic set of color names looks the same as ANSI:
#   black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white.
# And then we can modify any of those by saying (no space!):
#   dark${color}
# And finally, we can return to default colors with any of:
#   none, normal, off
#
# That all seems normal, but!  It's the "dark" colors which are the
# ANSI 3-bit standard colors!  Whereas, the unannotated color names
# mean the 4-bit bright/intense colors and also bold font!
#
#
# These colors are as close to my ~/.gitconfig as we can get.
# Notes:
# * these settings assume a dark-background terminal.
# * colordiff has no way to distinguish bold font vs bright/intense color.
# * git's "meta" seems to have no equivalent; the file info header
#   for --unified diffs just reuses newtext/oldtext.
# * git's "frag" == colordiff's "diffstuff"
# * I'm not sure what "cvsstuff" is for exactly.  (I'd thought it
#   was like git's "meta", but no.)
