In the sharing spirit of \*nix, here are a bunch of my dotfiles, a
few random scripts, and other odds and ends. Compared to my old
darcs repo for sharing this stuff, I've removed a bunch of the
[catzen](http://www.cat.pdx.edu/thecat.html) stuff and the old Perl
stuff; both of them because I no longer use them and so they're
probably bitrotten.
