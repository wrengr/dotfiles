# BUG: hg normally has `ci` mean the equivalent of `git commit -a`;
#   not sure if this alias will override that or no.
ci = commit --interactive
ca = commit
# This is the most common meaning for which I use the `git oo` alias.
# (N.B., mercurial does have `co` as an alias for update; and `oo`
# originated as a simplification of typing `co` anyways.)

# TODO: `hg rebase --stop`
# BUG: supposedly mercurial already has an 'amend' command; but it's
#   not showing up for me... (is it just fig not hg?) also it's equivalent
#   of `git commit --amend -a`; which I dislike.
amend = commit --amend --interactive
# Warning: for some reason this seems to take a long time to finish
# after it's printed that one commit.

# TODO: There's also `hg diff -c .` which is like `git show` with no
#   arguments, or technically closer to `git diff --cached HEAD^`.
#   I often use the no-argument `git show` for this purpose, but I
#   use arguments often enough that I'm not sure if `hg show` would be
#   a good alias.  N.B., for `.`=`tip` specifically there's also
#   `hg tip -p` which runs a bit faster and doesn't use $PAGER.

# TODO: how does the builtin `hg blame` compare to `hg annotate --user --number`?  Also, what's a good alias for `blame -u -c -l`?
