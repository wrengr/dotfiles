# BUG: we'll need to make a local copy since doing it this way gives us the following warning:
# Your configuration option extensions.figstatus points to a file at /google/src/head/depot/google3/experimental/fig_contrib/prompts/fig_status/fig_status.py. This path may have poor performance since it may lead to a server roundtrip for every access/every hg invocation.
# (to disable this warning, set `warn-head-paths=False` in the [trainingwheels] section of your ~/.hgrc)
