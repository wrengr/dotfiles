I often want to disable the capslock button because it's annoying and
too easily hit on my keyboard at work. The way to do this is:

    # <http://askubuntu.com/a/527385>
    $ setxkbmap -option caps:none

Which we can auto-run at startup via either: (1) going to "Startup
Applications > Add" and creating a "custom command" there for running it.
Or, (2) we can edit the crontab to add a @reboot line for running it.
I've done the former on my workstation, but we should prolly put something
in the dotfiles repo about this, so I don't lose it whenever they upgrade.

Or, if we'd rather remap it to something instead of disabling it, see
