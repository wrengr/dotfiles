N.B., ssh-config files are read top to bottom, and if more than one
Host matches then only the so-far-unspecified settings are applied
(i.e., there's no overriding). So be sure to order things apropriately.

N.B., the indentation is merely visually suggestive; it doesn't
actually do anything. If you want something to apply everywhere
(without exception) then you can put it at the 'top level' before
the first Host. If you want it to apply as a default (when not
otherwise specified) then you need to put it in a "Host *" stanza
at the end.

If you notice Vim being laggy, using compression helps.

TODO: We'd like to split up our ~/.ssh/config into multiple files,
since some of the Google-specific bits are managed by other repos
(and we don't want to copy them anyways). Alas, it looks like there's
no clean way to import files in ~/.ssh/config. Some new versions
of OpenSSL finally added that as a feature, but I'm not sure whether
we're running those new versions everywhere. So what I need to do
is design my own script for "compiling" a ~/.ssh/config file from
parts.
