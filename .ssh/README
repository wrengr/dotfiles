N.B., ssh-config files are read top to bottom, and if more than one
Host matches then only the so-far-unspecified settings are applied
(i.e., there's no overriding). So be sure to order things apropriately.
<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-custom-connection-options-for-your-ssh-client>

N.B., the indentation is merely visually suggestive; it doesn't
actually do anything. If you want something to apply everywhere
(without exception) then you can put it at the 'top level' before
the first Host. If you want it to apply as a default (when not
otherwise specified) then you need to put it in a "Host *" stanza
at the end.

If you notice Vim being laggy, using compression helps.

TODO: We'd like to split up our ~/.ssh/config into multiple files,
since some of the Google-specific bits are managed by other repos
(and we don't want to copy them anyways). Alas, it looks like there's
no clean way to import files in ~/.ssh/config. Version 7.3p1 of
OpenSSL finally added that as a feature <https://superuser.com/a/1142813/79980>,
but not everywhere is up to that (e.g., haskell_community is still
running OpenSSH_5.1p1 as of 2017.07.21). Thus, we'd have to write
our own script for compiling a unified ~/.ssh/config from parts.
Or maybe we can use <https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-ssh-config.d>?
