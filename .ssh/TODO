We'd like to split up our ~/.ssh/config into multiple files, since
some of the Google-specific bits are managed by other repos (and
we don't want to copy them anyways). Alas, it looks like there's
no clean way to import files in ~/.ssh/config. Some new versions
of OpenSSL finally added that as a feature, but I'm not sure whether
we're running those new versions everywhere. So what I need to do
is design my own script for "compiling" a ~/.ssh/config file from
parts. This TODO file is here to remind me to do this.
