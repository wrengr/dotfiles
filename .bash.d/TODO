== prompts ==

We might should move the ~/local/lib/prompts stuff into ~/.bash.d instead

Also check out the section of
SEEKRIT
which has a different take on what to put in the prompt.  In particular
they have stuff about doing things asynchronously and caching the results,
to speed everything up.  Albeit, they're using fish rather than bash or
even zsh...

== ssh ==

May want to add something like this to our ~/.bash_profile (or factored
out as a function in ~/.bash.d)

    if [ -x /usr/local/scripts/ssx-agents ] ; then
      [ "$PS1" ] && eval `/usr/local/scripts/ssx-agents $SHELL`
    fi

similarly we may want to update ~/local/bin/legate to use:

    ssh-add -l | grep ${USER} > /dev/null 2>&1

To check for running agents before sourcing the file, rather than our
current hackery with `ps`. ====> NOPE. The above only works when SSH_AGENT_PID is already set.
