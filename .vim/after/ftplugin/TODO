Set all the b:undo_ftplugin for things in this directory

Adjust YAML. The &indentexpr set by /opt/sw/share/vim/vim82/indent/yaml.vim
does some very annoying reindent on `:` stuff (akin to the old
&smartindent); in particular the annoying thing is that it does
that reindentation when the character is typed in a comment line!
* It may be sufficient to replace <:> with : in &indentkeys...
  Though the plain : might not work since it depends on following
  a "label or case statement", so we'd have to make sure to configure
  that right for YAML.
* Alternatively, the problem may be how GetYAMLIndent() handles
  comment lines.  On the one hand, if both the current and previous
  lines are comments, then the current line is set to match the
  previous (which is good).  But otherwise it will try to set the
  comment line to match the previous non-blank non-comment line; which
  is no good when we want a comment *above* the next line which is
  outdented relative to the previous.  To fix this, it may be sufficient
  to just add our own check first and if the current line is a comment
  line and the last typed character is : then leave it alone; otherwise
  fallback to GetYAMLIndent().
