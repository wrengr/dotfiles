== What the heck goes where in here? ==

This blog post has a nice summary of the directory structure in
~/.vim/, including a bunch of directories I don't have (yet)
    <http://www.panozzaj.com/blog/2011/09/09/vim-directory-structure/>


== How do I manage all this stuff? ==

There are a plethora of different plugin managers for vim, all in
various states of deprecation and unmaintinence. For my part, I'm
going to (try to) use vim-plug, which appears to be the latest and
greatest of the options.

Of course, I also want to have my own homerolled stuff, and don't
want it to get trounced by plugin managers. So where should I put
that stuff?
