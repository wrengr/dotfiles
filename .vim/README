=== What the heck goes where in the ~/.vim directory? ===

This blog post has a nice summary of the directory structure in
~/.vim/, including a bunch of directories I don't have (yet)

=== How do I manage all this stuff? ===

There are a plethora of different plugin managers for vim, all in
various states of deprecation and unmaintinence. For my part, I'm
going to (try to) use vim-plug, which appears to be the latest and
greatest of the options.
    <https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug>

Of course, I also want to have my own homerolled stuff, and don't
want it to get trounced by plugin managers. So where should I put
that stuff?
