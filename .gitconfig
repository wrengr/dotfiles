    # This was originally intended as a paltry attempt to commute

    # rebased/rewrote the shared history, then that's when `--onto`
    # becomes necessary.  In particular, for the `--onto` version to
    # work properly, you need to pass `HEAD~N` where `N` is the number
    # of patches in the child branch since diverging from the original
    # version of the parent before the parent got rebased.  Alas,
    # there's no good way to auto-detect what that `N` should be, so

    # set up a new branch name for the parent before rebasing the
    # parent, then you can use that branch name.
    #
    # Supposedly this should look at "branch.<name>.remote" and
    # "branch.<name>.merge" (just like the no-argument `git pull` does),
    # select all the commits between then (exclusive) and the most recent
    # one (inclusive), commute them to occur after the parent branch,
    # and set the current branch to point to that new end-of-commits.

    # commits on the floor and sets the current branch to point
    # directly to the parent.  I've no idea why that happens; but
