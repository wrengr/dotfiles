     path, then the translator package will now be automatically

     sequence followed by a group, in which case the first
     object in the group is converted to uppercase. Examples:

     \makefirstuc{abc}        -> Abc
     \makefirstuc{\emph{abc}} -> \emph{Abc}
     \makefirstuc{{\'a}bc}    -> {\'A}bc
     \makefirstuc{\ae bc}     -> \AE bc
     \makefirstuc{{\ae}bc}    -> {\AE}bc

     (but don't do \makefirstuc{\ae{}bc} which produces \ae Bc.)
