% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
% Because (something like) this is only defined in the book.cls
\newenvironment{frontmatter}{%
	\setcounter{page}{1}%   Reset counting so this can be used as backmatter too
	\cleardoublepage%       Probably unneeded, but just in case and just because
	\thispagestyle{plain}%  Should only affect the first page of the frontmatter
	\pagenumbering{roman}%
}{%
	\cleardoublepage%       Make sure to start non-frontmatter on the right page
	\pagenumbering{arabic}% Must be after \cleardoublepage for the roman to work
%                               for single-page frontmatters
	\setcounter{page}{1}%   Reset counting so it works as expected
}

%% Within the frontmatter environment, you should use the \section*{} variant
%% The asterix gets rid of showing the section number, but more importantly
%% it removes the section from the TOC
