% This file only captures the remnants not broken out into my Papers
% directory, eventually this too will be broken out there. In time
% I might recombine them if I can find/create a nice tool for entity
% tracking in order to simplify the names of journals, authors,
% etc.  Apparently BibTeX offers some small amount of support for
% doing this for InBook and InProceedings, but nowhere else.
%
% We can use braces to group and collapse things since anything
% not in an entry is considered a comment (so we don't really need
% the %s) But remember, no -at- symbols anywhere except for entries
%
% To include this file and use good style:
% 0.  `export BSTINPUTS=.:~/local/latex/:` to find *.bst files
% 0.5 `export BIBINPUTS=.:~/local/latex/:` to find *.bib files
% 1. Have \usepackage{lsalike} in the preamble, or \...{natref}
% 2. Cite things somewhere
% 3. Have \bibliographystyle{lsalike} \bibliography{athenaeum} in
%    the end
% 4. And run `pdflatex $_ && bibtex $_ && pdflatex $_ && pdflatex
%    $_` where $_ is the file name sans extension (bibtex chokes
%    on the extension) Should only need to rerun bibtex if/when we
%    cite different things.
