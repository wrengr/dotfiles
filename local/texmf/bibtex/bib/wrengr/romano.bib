    abstract = {In this thesis I investigate evidence of differential performance between males and females in the area of phonology. The study looks at the use of prosody for syntactic disambiguation based on Ilse Lehiste's 1973 non-gender based study of the same phenomenon.
    
    Eight speakers (4m, 4f) read through nine ambiguous sentences three times: once prior to being informed that the sentences were ambiguous, and twice afterwards, attempting to evoke each reading. Twenty-four listeners (12m, 12f) then listened to four of the speakers (2m, 2f). After each token they
    identified the intended meaning of the speaker, and after
    each block of tokens by a single speaker they answered
    questions about the speaker including identifying their
    gender.
    
    A very strong bias was found for the listeners labeling all
    speakers as male; what effect the speaker's gender had on
    the listener's response was a negative correlation. Women
    were also found to identify the speaker as female 1.5 times
    as often as male listeners. Five of the nine sentences were
    disambiguated at better than chance levels, supporting
    Lehiste's findings that speakers do phonologically disambiguate.
    Effects on the listeners' accuracy at identifying the
    speakers' intended meaning were found for the reading of
    the sentence, the specific sentence, and the ambiguity type.
    There is a suggestion of an interaction between the speaker's
    gender and the reading of the sentence. And it appears that
    male and female speakers prefer different methods of phonetic
    disambiguation.}

    abstract = {We present a generalized unification algorithm
    where nodes in the graphs being unified can specify strategies
    for iterating over possible terms, as well as specifying
    strategies for iterating over subterms to unify recursively.
    In order to specify these strategies, the implementation
    of a particular type of term must be permitted to partially
    override the general unification mechanism. As it turns
    out, partially overriding unification also allows for terms
    which are existentially typed, which in turn allows declaring
    new numeric terms like \texttt{complex(3,0)} in a manner
    that permits them to unify according to mathematical equality
    with other numeric terms like 3 rather than relying only
    on structural unification and a special escape mechanism
    for dealing with numerical computations. This diffuse
    unification algorithm can be combined with efficient
    implementations for backtracking search to create a powerful
    framework for logic programming languages.}

    abstract = {Static type systems can express many program
    invariants, which allow compilers of typed languages to
    catch a large class of programming errors, aid in verifying
    properties of programs, and optimize generated code. Logic
    programming languages like Prolog have traditionally been
    untyped, and have not benefited from strong type systems.
    Functional--logic programming languages like Curry are
    typed, but they generally provide weaker forms of unification
    than untyped logic programming languages. This paper explores
    the design space of type systems for Dyna, a typed
    weighted-logic programming language with memoization. The
    main contribution of this work is providing a unification
    algorithm for a basic system of types including non-linear
    type terms, primitive types, union types, and recursive
    types.}

    It provides these benefits in large part by abandoning
    traditional notions of constituency. Despite this, providing
    a clean account of scrambling in non-configurational languages
    is not much simpler than in traditional formalisms. We
    present a new family of $\lambda$-calculi for the semantic

    cross-linguistic patterns, including modelling the existence
    of constraints on permissible phrase orderings. Specific
    applications of the new calculi are given for nominative,
    accusitive, and dative case marking in Japanese.}
