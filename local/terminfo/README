This directory is just a place for me to store non-compiled terminfo files
(i.e., it's not any standard location); whereas, ~/.terminfo is where the
compiled files should be stored.  Note that when you run `tic`, it will
automatically place the results into ~/.terminfo for you; however, beware
that OSX and Linux use different directory structures underneath that (e.g.,
~/.terminfo/x/xterm* vs ~/.terminfo/78/xterm*) which is why we do not check
those files into the github repo.  See <https://stackoverflow.com/a/55644975>
regarding the fact that this approach is the correct, robust, long-term
solution to things; in lieu of directly messing around with environment
variables TERM, TERMCAP, TERMINFO, etc.  (If you need to use termcap in lieu
of terminfo, then ~/.termcap is the corresponding place to put the compiled
files.)

For adding italics support to iTerm2:

To test that you did everything right:
  $> echo "$(tput sitm)${TERM}$(tput ritm)"

TODO: Add variants for:
  - `*-bce` for supporting BCE
  - `*-s` for supporting dsl/fsl/tsl (see `man 5 terminfo` for what that means)

TODO: To avoid needing separate files for each of our configurations,
consider writing a script that uses the `cat <<EOF|tic -x -` idiom described
in the iTerm2 link above.
