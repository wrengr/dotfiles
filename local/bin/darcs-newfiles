# This is like `darcs w -ls` but can be much faster

# BUG(github#10): darcs-2.14.1 no longer has the `query` command.
#
# This is a hack to workaround things for a little while:
MANIFEST='darcs-2.10.0 query manifest'
#MANIFEST='darcs-2.14.1 show files'

# Try to discern watched directories
$MANIFEST |
  perl -ne' print "$1\n" if m/(.*)\//' |

        l=$($MANIFEST | grep "$file$" | wc -l)
