# For use with git: <https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/diff-highlight>
# BUG: this is no longer picking up on git-diff's colors.
# BUG: users are forced to manually pipe the output to their pager, and by default `less` will show control characters rather than executing them.
# Both of those can be fixed via the incantation:
# $> git diff --color=always ... | diff-highlight | less -isqR
# (N.B., the -isq flags aren't strictly required, they're just my preferred.)
# The commentor mentioning diff-so-fancy below suggests using `less -FRXsu --tabs=4` here
#
# As commented at <https://stackoverflow.com/a/15149253#comment76619242_15149253>
# we may rather try to use the last version before it got turned into a module:
# <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/fd99e2bda0ca6a361ef03c04d6d7fdc7a9c40b78/contrib/diff-highlight/diff-highlight>
#
# TODO: when there are multiple changes on a line the default module will
# highlight everything between the start of the first and end of the last;
# we may prefer a heuristic to find smaller diffs.
#
# TODO: despite this module being shipped with git these days,
# we'd probably be better off using something like diff-so-fancy
# <https://stackoverflow.com/a/39504214> instead.
