#!/usr/bin/osascript -s o
-- Print the urls of all open tabs, one per line, for easily saving to a file.
-- N.B., due to AppleScript bugginess this prints to stderr not stdout!
-- BUG: according to the manpage the "-s o" flag to osascript will tell it to "log" to stdout instead of the default stderr ("-s e"); however, that's not actually happening.
