# Enscripted to deal with Solaris' broken Bourne shell, though I
# suppose `echo` could be contorted to do this if manipulated
# properly.
#
# could also use `sed 's/[[:space:]][[:space:]]*/ /g;
#                      s/^[[:space:]]*\(.*\)[[:space:]]*/\1/'`
# if you thought that looked intelligible enough
#
# `perl -Mstrict -Wpe 's/\s+/\x20/g; s/^\s*(.*?)\s*$/$1\n/'`
# works on the commandline, but the shebang does something wierd
# with the -e stuff.
