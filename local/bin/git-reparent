# N.B., by naming this as we have and having it on our path, this

# no aliases required!

# TODO: Add a flag to toggle color for the error messages
# TODO: Add flags for verbose mode & for dryrun mode
# TODO: allow NEW_PARENT to be a commit-id, rather than forcing it
# to be a branch-id. And if it's a commit-id, then skip the final
# `git branch --set-upstream-to=` part. (Perhaps using a different
# executable name, if we can't automatically distinguish between the
# two cases.)
# TODO: cf., <https://github.com/MarkLodato/git-reparent> for doing
# better about commuting patches rather than the git bs about applying
# diffs.  <http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/Announcing-git-reparent-tp7574982p7575061.html>
# TODO: cf., <https://stackoverflow.com/a/5344979> about a safer
# way to do the rebase--onto without risking damage to the original
# unrebased branch.  We should prolly refactor that into this script
# in order to automate recovery in the event of rebase failure.

Usage: ${0##*/} NEW_PARENT

Change the parent of the current branch to NEW_PARENT. This will not only
change which branch is _called_ the parent, but also take all the commits
since this branch diverged from its old/current parent and rebase them
onto the new parent.

N.B., if you just want to initialize/set the parent pointer and
don't need any rebasing (e.g., because you just created a new branch
in detatched-head state), then instead of using this script you can
simply: \`git branch --set-upstream-to=NEW_PARENT\`
