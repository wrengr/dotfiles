# The original, mostly-magical almost-one liner. In light of perl's
# inefficiency with `map` I've reverted back to this version. It's
# even simpler on the cli instead of in a script:
#
# perl -nle 's/^\s*(.*?)\s*$/$1/o; push @ls, join ".", reverse split /\./;
#            END {print join ".", reverse split /\./ foreach sort @ls}'

use strict;

foreach (<>) { s/^\s*(.*?)\s*$/$1/o; push @_, join '.', reverse split /\./ }
print '', (join '.', reverse split /\./), "\n" foreach sort @_;

exit 0;
__END__

# This is the nearly points-free functional version, which is
# interesting to see though less efficient since perl fails at `map`

print
	map { (join '.', reverse split /\./)
		. "\n" # Because doing ``join "\n", map...`` misses the last one
		}
	sort
	map { s/^\s*(.*?)\s*$/$1/o  # A bit more robust than chomp
		; join '.', reverse split /\./
		}
	<>;
