In order to enable Unicode, you need four things:
(1) locale configured to use it
(2) screen configured to use it
(3) irssi configured to use it
(4) Restart your login, screen, and irssi sessions. The shell and
    screen in particular typically don't admit just updating the
    configs; you need to restart the processes. Be sure to pass
    irssi the -U flag too.

My ~/.irssi/config and ~/.screenrc files cover the second two points.
However, the first point needs to be handled differently for each
distro. For FreeBSD, the best method is to have a ~/.login_conf
file which sets things up. Since that's not necessary for OSX, I
don't want that file littering up my homedir. Thus, the .login_conf
file used on Bastion (reaver.cat.pdx.edu as of this writting) is
stored in *this* directory in order to move it out of the way.


# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# ~~~~~ The hard way

After getting the locale set up by hook or by crook, add

    defutf8 on

to your ~/.screenrc or you can try to avoid restarting by doing

    Ctrl-a :utf8 on

Then, within irssi, do

    /set term_charset utf-8

for the main part of it. Then if you want to recode everything so
that you can interact with folks using other encodings, then do

	/set recode_autodetect_utf8 ON
	/set recode_fallback UTF-8
	/set recode ON
	/set recode_out_default_charset UTF-8
	/set recode_transliterate ON

and finally do

    /save
